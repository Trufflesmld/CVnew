      I’m a beginner in front-end. I’ve decided to become a front-end dev on my
      third year in the university. My goal is to learn as much as possible to
      be proud of things I do. It’s not about prestige or something like that,
      front-end is something inspiring, kind of art, where you can create
      beautiful and useful applications and every time you will learn a lot of
      new information. So, my goal is to do my best.
